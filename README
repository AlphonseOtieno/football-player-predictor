Football Player Value & Potential Predictor - Alphonse Otieno
A Streamlit application for predicting football player transfer values and potential classifications using machine learning models.

Description
This application helps football scouts, managers, and enthusiasts evaluate players based on key performance metrics. It predicts a player's market value and classifies them into potential categories (Star, Reliable, or Dud) using machine learning.

Features
Predict player transfer values based on performance statistics
Classify players into potential categories
Explore football player data through interactive visualizations
Compare player predictions with similar players in the database
Understand model performance and feature importance
