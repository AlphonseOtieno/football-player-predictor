st.markdown("""
For the most accurate predictions, consider the following:

1. **Age Matters**: Generally, players between 23-28 years have the highest transfer values as they combine experience with future potential.

2. **Performance Stats**: Goals and assists significantly impact a player's valuation, especially for attacking players.

3. **Overall Rating**: This is one of the strongest predictors of both transfer value and player classification.

4. **Experience**: The number of matches played helps establish a player's consistency and reliability.

5. **Position Context**: Remember that different positions have different expected statistics. For example:
   - Strikers: High goals, moderate assists
   - Midfielders: Moderate goals, high assists
   - Defenders: Low goals and assists, but high match counts
